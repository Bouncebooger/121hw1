My scene is a goofy ecosystem being exploed by a drone.
I included mushrooms, grass, trees, and some flora and fauna of my own. 
I was inspired by my love for nature documentaries.
The main character is the afformentioned drone.
Tree_01, Grass_01,Rock_01,Mushroom_01,Mushroom_02 are all from the SimpleNaturePack, Got for free on the asset store.
Schlurper, Shlurpplant,strangeplant,girrahedron,drone,and frong are all made by me along with the terrain.
Cube is a object primitive.

I made a point, spotlight, directional, lights. I also made a emissive material particle system (I think, its a bit of a mess)
I made a day night cycle as well.
I would like some comments on why my laptop, ryzen 9 5000 series would chug when having to do baked lighting with an area light.
I assume it is the size of the map, or some very unoptimized models getting imported. 
please let me know :)
