My scene is a goofy ecosystem being exploed by a drone.
I included mushrooms, grass, trees, and some flora and fauna of my own. 
I was inspired by my love for nature documentaries.
The main character is the afformentioned drone.
Tree_01, Grass_01,Rock_01,Mushroom_01,Mushroom_02 are all from the SimpleNaturePack, Got for free on the asset store.
Schlurper, Shlurpplant,strangeplant,girrahedron,drone,and frong are all made by me along with the terrain.
Cube is a object primitive.
